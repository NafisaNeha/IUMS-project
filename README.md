# UniversityManagementSystem
Project Name: Integrated University Management System (IUMS)

Introduction:
The “Integrated University Management System” project is a window-based application project. Integrated University Management System (IUMS) deals with the maintenance of university, faculty, and student information within the university. It is an automation system, which is used to store the university, faculty, student, courses, and information of a university.
This software mainly focuses on basic operations in university management as well as some special features like the facility of user login, faculty login, and administrative login. New users can open a user account quite easily after filling out a registration form provided with the user name and password. All the necessary information about the university will be saved in the MySQL database and it will show in the user interface (UI). Starting from the registration of a new student in the university, it maintains all the details regarding the attendance and marks of the students and also collects the details of a faculty member and the information will be saved in the same database. The purpose of this software is to improve the quality of education, ease one’s daily operations, digitalize data collection and management, optimize resources and improve communication. IUMS helps make important tasks like results processing, registration, and attendance management more efficient, so they can be done faster. All users, including students and university personnel, paper valuers, setters, and moderators, are given a role-based login/password to complete their tasks.

Software Platform:

1. JAVA (Swing)
2. NetBeans 8.2 IDE
